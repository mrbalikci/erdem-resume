1. Name: World Refugee Crisis
* Tools Used: JavaScript, Python, CSS/HTML, D3, Leaflet, Flask, Pandas, Numpy, SQLite, Sqlalchemy, Plotly
* Description: [Back End] Explored, analyzed messy data sets from World Bank for asylum, refugee, battle related deaths for all countries since 1990. Accomplished an animated world map that shows the refugees, asylum, battle data with corresponding values, different layers by converting the data into SQLite database and reading with python by sqlalchemy queries for Flask API routes. Measured, calculated the plots, charts by using JavaScript. [Front End] Visualized all the calculations by using HTML/CSS and deployed with Heroku App.

2. Name: Star Trek Cast Reunion
* Tools Used: Python, Matplotlib, API Interactions, Statistical Modeling
* Description: Launched API Movie Data Base for guest stars of Star Trek Original. Other movies analyzed based on their appearances. Top 10 movies were detected. Most guest star actors who were still active discovered. Formulated most popular production companies among the guest stars. Architected mosaics based on the collected pictures from the API.
